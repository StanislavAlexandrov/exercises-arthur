        'A wild week on Wall Street ended as it began: with the retail army blowing up short bets, punishing hedge funds and minting small fortunes off the most-hated shares.',
        'Following relentless promotion on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, GameStop Corp. surged 68% on Friday, taking its five-day gain to a staggering 400% as the S&P 500 Index fell 3.3%.',
        'Shares of the video-game retailer had tumbled Thursday, when popular investment platforms including Robinhood began restricting trades. But the rally revived after the curbs were eased.',
        'Something else that survived the week: the gaping chasm in sentiment between day-trading faithful who view GameStop as the emblem of their populist ransacking of Wall Street, and industry professionals who are convinced the bubble will burst.',

        "During Jackson's second term, his opponents had gradually come together to form the Whig Party. Whigs and Democrats held different attitudes toward the changes brought about by the market, banks, and commerce. The Democrats tended to view society as a continuing conflict between 'the people'-farmers, planters, and workers-and a set of greedy aristocrats. ",
        "Whigs and Democrats differed not only in their attitudes toward the market but also about how active the central government should be in people's lives. Despite Andrew Jackson's inclination to be a strong President, Democrats as a rule believed in limited government. ",

        'Most recent laptops and all-in-one desktops have a decent — sometimes even great — built-in camera, so many people don’t need a standalone webcam.',
        'Any webcam needs a clip that makes it simple to attach it to a variety of laptop screens and desktop monitors, and it should be easy to tilt the mic up or down to adjust the view. ',
        'Most webcams include a noise-cancelling microphone so that you can be easily heard when you’re chatting in a room with a little ambient noise (like a ceiling fan).',
        'All of these webcams are automatically detected by Windows 10, macOS, and other modern operating systems, but fine-tuning certain settings like the field of view is made easier with the help of this software.',
        'In addition to the software settings, you can physically tilt the webcam up or down to control what’s in frame.',
        'The C920S does struggle in a dimly lit room—the frame rate drops as the camera adjusts its exposure settings to keep you visible, and you’ll see more image noise and less detail.',

        'If you’re concerned about being too sedentary or if you feel pain after sitting for long periods, you should consider switching to a standing desk.',
        'If you’re looking to add more physical activity to your day, to lose weight, or to improve your brain power—supposed advantages that some desk manufacturers might try to sell you on—there’s no proof that a standing desk can do any of that for you. ',
        'If you haven’t tried a standing desk before and you’re not sure you want to invest in one, you can create a makeshift version by using a cardboard box or several reams of paper to raise your monitor and keyboard.',
